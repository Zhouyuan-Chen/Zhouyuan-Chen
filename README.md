# Hi, I am Cavers Chen and this is my temporary personal website!

I am a ZJUT student and my interest is computer graphics, because computer graphics is awesome!!!

Since this page is built for people to get to know me more quickly, you can check the following projects in that I have participated related to CG.

### Tooth Medical Software:

### Rendering Engine:
with the tutorial of Peter Shirley, I had a basic understanding of ray tracing algorithms. Also, I read some related books he recommended in this tutorial for further learning, such as Advanced Global Illumination. Later I wrote a fluid simulation solver, however, this part of the code was missed because of an error on my computer(I should regularly upload my code...)

* final work of part one (use 12 hours to get this result)

### Shadertoy

I was fansinated with those amazing effect solely made by shader. In this aspect, Inigo Quilez is GOD(Don't know Inigo Quilez? check this [youtuber](https://www.youtube.com/c/InigoQuilez).)

Inspired by some shaders which imitate the effect of cloud, I did some research and found this specific effect is created by fractal noise(Fractal Brownian Motion-FBM), you can use this to create the wave, cloud, end even landscape!

* shallow wave [check the source code and video](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/fs3cRn)

### My First Game With C

The beginning of my dream. I wrote this in my first summer vacation when I was a first year undergraduate. I learned a simple graphics library called EasyX, which is simple as it said. This game first be realized on VS2017, later the game was ported to the BC platform. I remained the code, but unfortunately, the video of this game I played were missed.

* I also wrote some small games while I tried to code this project, you can check all of them here!

### NetEase EStar-Plan

This is an open class offered by an Internet company, and I am honored to be able to participate. I learned how to write basic GLSL language in this class, implemented some basic functions(camera function, PBR, IBL), and found there is a big gap between industry and academia in computer graphics.

### Recent Study

#### ColCal(Collision Calculation Library)

Currently, I am working on implementing a collision detection library, I call it ColCal(Collision Calculation Library). Now you can check the source code by clicking this link!

#### Geometry Processing

I am taking a digital geometry processing course these days by finishing online [coursework](https://github.com/eth-igl/GP2022-Assignments). I finished assignment 4 last week and professor Panozzo's [materials](https://github.com/danielepanozzo/gp) are very helpful.

I found that there is a lot of fun in geometry since many fantastic works are based on it, such as using mesh to assist factors in producing tooth model, sweaters or even plastic(inflatable bag which can change it's shape). Now, I set this repo as private, so, you can't find this in my acount. 

#### Misc

This early year, I relatively have more spare time, so I would like learn some interesting things.

* I learned some stuff about NPR(I read this [tutorial](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02189483/file/contour_tutorial.pdf) and had a basic understanding of the NPR), especially the line-drawing algorithms. Doing so helps me review my knowledge of topology, hope I am able to make an interesting demo later...

* Meanwhile, since my former simulation code was missed, I plan to realize particle-based simulation and grid-based simulation these days.
* * [source code](https://github.com/Cavers-Chen/PhysicalSimulation)

* Reading an OS tutorial and making DIY-operation system.
* * [source_code](https://github.com/Cavers-Chen/OS-Development)

### Future Plan

After entering graduate college, I would like to make my study more specific and focus on one of the aspects of geometry/simulation/rendering.
